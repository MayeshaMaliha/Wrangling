The most common tasks in string processing include:
1. extracting numbers from strings
2. removing unwanted characters from text
3. finding and replacing characters
4. extracting specific parts of strings
5. converting free form text to more uniform formats
6. splitting strings into multiple values

The stringr package in the tidyverse contains string processing functions that follow a similar naming format (str_functionname) and are compatible with the pipe.
