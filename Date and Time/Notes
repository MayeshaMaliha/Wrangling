Key points

Dates are a separate data type in R.The tidyverse includes functionality for dealing with dates through the lubridate package. 
Extract the year, month and day from a date object with the year(), month() and day() functions.
Parsers convert strings into dates with the standard YYYY-MM-DD format (ISO 8601 format). Use the parser with the name corresponding to the string format of year, month and day (ymd(), ydm(), myd(), mdy(), dmy(), dym()).
Get the current time with the Sys.time() function. Use the now() function instead to specify a time zone.
You can extract values from time objects with the hour(), minute() and second() functions.
Parsers convert strings into times (for example, hms()). Parsers can also create combined date-time objects (for example, mdy_hms()).
