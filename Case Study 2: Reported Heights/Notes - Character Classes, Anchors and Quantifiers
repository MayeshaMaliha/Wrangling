1. Define strings to test your regular expressions, including some elements that match and some that do not. This allows you to check for the two types of errors: failing to match and matching incorrectly.
2. Square brackets define character classes: groups of characters that count as matching the pattern. You can use ranges to define character classes, such as [0-9] for digits and [a-zA-Z] for all letters.
3. Anchors define patterns that must start or end at specific places. ^ and $ represent the beginning and end of the string respectively.
4. Curly braces are quantifiers that state how many times a certain character can be repeated in the pattern. \\d{1,2} matches exactly 1 or 2 consecutive digits.
