1. A regular expression (regex) is a way to describe a specific pattern of characters of text. A set of rules has been designed to do this specifically and efficiently.
2. stringr functions can take a regex as a pattern.
3. str_detect() indicates whether a pattern is present in a string.
4. The main difference between a regex and a regular string is that a regex can include special characters.
5. The | symbol inside a regex means "or".
6. Use '\\d' to represent digits. The backlash is used to distinguish it from the character 'd'. In R, you must use two backslashes for digits in regular expressions; in some other languages, you will only use one backslash for regex special characters.
7. str_view() highlights the first occurrence of a pattern, and the str_view_all() function highlights all occurrences of the pattern.
