the_names_2 <- the_names_2 %>%
  str_trim() %>%
  str_split("\\s+", simplify = TRUE)

# Now we can join these to generate one name for each column:

# Now we are ready to get the actual data. By examining the tab object, we notice that the information is in lines 6 through 14. We can use str_split() again to achieve our goal:
new_research_funding_rates <- tab[6:14] %>%

# We can see that the objects are identical:
identical(research_funding_rates, new_research_funding_rates)
