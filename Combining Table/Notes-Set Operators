By default, the set operators in R-base work on vectors. If tidyverse/dplyr are loaded, they also work on data frames.
You can take intersections of vectors using intersect(). This returns the elements common to both sets.
You can take the union of vectors using union(). This returns the elements that are in either set.
The set difference between a first and second argument can be obtained with setdiff(). Note that this function is not symmetric.
The function set_equal() tells us if two sets are the same, regardless of the order of elements.
